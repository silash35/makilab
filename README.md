# Makilab

This is the offline version of the Makilab software. Now it is a program that runs locally without the need for internet. It is recommended for companies that are not interested in maintaining a Web server.
Some features, such as the client interface, have been removed, as they only make sense on a remote server

All code is in the public domain. So feel free to customize it to your company's needs and use freely
